Research for the book developing startup:

The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. 
City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; 
more people were at home, reading books. 
That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers.

In this research we'll work with the database of one of the services competing in this market. 
It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. 
This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.

Main questions to answer:
- number of books released after January 1, 2000.
- number of user reviews and the average rating for each book.
- identifying the publisher that has released the greatest number of books with more than 50 pages 
(excluding brochures and similar publications from your analysis).
- identifying the author with the highest average book rating (books with at least 50 ratings).
- average number of text reviews among users who rated more than 50 books.
