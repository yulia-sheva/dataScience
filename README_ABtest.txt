User behaviour research for the international online store

Given research is investigating user behaviour for an international online store.
We start with the sales funnel to find out how users reach the purchase stage, 
how many users actually make it to this stage and how many get stuck at previous stages.
Then we'll look at the results of an A/B test regarding changes related to the introduction 
of an improved recommendation system: Expected result: within 14 days of signing up, 
users will show better conversion into product page views (the product_page event), 
product card views (product_card) and purchases (purchase). 

At each of the stage of the funnel product_page → product_card → purchase, there will be at least a 10% increase.
The users are split into 2 groups: 
А (control group - get the old payment funnel), 
B (test group - gets the new payment funnel).
